# bionic-stabilizer

Project for stabilization of hands. The name was inspired by the
[World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/start) leather wrist item
[Mo'arg Bionic Stabilizers](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137090/moarg-bionic-stabilizers?ilvl=910).
The tag line was *If you can stabilize a saw you can stabilize a glaive.*

As this is an experiment to help my father with his tremors, that
was obviously a sign.
